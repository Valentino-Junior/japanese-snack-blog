            traditional meals, while other times they're influenced by European and
            international snack foods.

                        Mochi is traditionally eaten at festivals especially at New

                        year not only provides warmth and nourishment. It is also thought
                        to impart strength, endurance and good health, to get you through

                        a mochi? The mochi cakes are beautiful circular buns made of soft
                        and chewy rice. Rice is steamed before being pounded and mashed.
                        The final mochi shape is made from the sticky rice mass, which is
                        then baked or boiled.Click here to see more about packaging and where to buy them. <a

                    "mystery flavor" with a salad, roast, or tomato Pretz.These long-selling Japanese snacks continue to
                    be enjoyed by many since 1963.Flavours include: Butter Soy Sauce, Pizza, Delicious Smoked Cheese,

                    Karaage is a type of fried chicken that is only found in Japan. It's crackly crisp, juicy as only
                    dark-meat chicken can be, with a tart zing from a squeeze of lemon, and a rich, savory aroma
                    imparted by the duck fat.
                    Karaage is a popular Japanese snack that may be found in
                    convenience stores around the country, as well as in izakaya and
                    more substantial meals like rice bowls and curries.Karaage are
                    always in a small ball shape, making them convenient to eat in a
                    single bite and perfect for putting on a skewer.The lightness of
                    karaage sets it apart from other types of fried chicken. Karaage
                    is powdered, soft, and fluffy; it isn't heavy, oily, or dense in
                    the way it feels or tastes. It has a unique flavor and may be
                    purchased as a single Japanese snack at a convenience store for a
                    very low price.
